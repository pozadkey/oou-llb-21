Glory be to God at last God made the D-day possible for us ALL as we became law graduates today and won the prestigious academics award of having the suffix ""LLB"" to our Names... Truly, ""the only impossible journey in life, is the one you never begin... Nevertheless, let\'s ALL be mindful that: ""Graduation is not the end; it\'s the beginning of another phase towards our success in life"". To this end, we should know that our passing out from the ""Almighty - Faculty of Law of the OOU"" at this stage should not be taken as greatest attainment for us now to shout ""Urel or Eureka"" because ""EXCELLENT IS NOT A SUCCESS BUT A JOURNEY TO GREATNESS..."" To this end, we ALL just begin our journey to excellence and greatness in life and as we all purse our Law-Career or any other Life-Career, let\'s dream big and purse our Dreams with truth, honesty, faithfulness, courage, caution, determination, passion and zeal with faith in God, knowing fully well that the future belongs to those who believe in the genuiness as well as the reality and the beauty of their Dreams with ABSOLUTE TRUST in GOD.... Finally, in our journey to greatness in life, I admonish us ALL to: ""NEVER TAKE A SHORT-CUT because IF YOU TAKE THE ROUTE OF SHORT-CUT TO GREATNESS, YOU WILL BE CUT-SHORT..."" It my sincere PRAY that none of us shall be CUT-SHORT in the Law-career and in our lives in JESUS NAME...Amen Congratulations, the Great Legal Achievers \'21"'),
