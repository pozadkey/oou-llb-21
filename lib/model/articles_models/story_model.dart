          '“Life is a gift.” Mama repeated it every chance she got. I do not know if she said it so she would not feel the uselessness of ours or because she believed it. Eventually, I came to agree. Life was indeed a gift, even if I had never known a full belly. Sometimes, when I passed Iya Bose\'s food stand and saw plates of unfinished food, I would wonder how it felt to eat till you were full, unable to eat more. I would soon know the feeling and I had life to thank. Mr Adepoju\'s wife had finally given birth. A new life had been brought into earth and he killed a cow a whole cow! He invited the neighborhood to celebrate with him, Mama went to help them cook and she came home with a nylon of meat. We never had meat in the house,only cracked eggs we bought from Iya Soji at reduced prices. On seeing the nylon of meat, I wished to see the child, kiss her and thank her. To my surprise,mama told us we could come to the party. My four siblings and I rushed to put on our clothes with the least holes and ran to the Adepoju\'s house, I followed suit even though I knew that Mr Adepoju was crazy.\nI had know this fact for a while. Infact We all knew. He drove his bus to a nearby city and took people to Lagos from there. When he got back, he told the wildest stories. I would sit still, listening to his stories. He said that if you put a card in the wall money would come out. We said “Ah!” He said there was a pathway on water and people drove on it. We said “Iro ni!” At the end of these stories we would laugh and I would think that it was so sad, that he had lost his mind. Yet we gathered to listen to the words of a mad man whenever we could. When we got to the party,food was shared. If your plate was getting empty, his in-laws would gingerly ask if you wanted more. Without waiting for an answer, they would collect the plate from you and would return a full plate.I wondered if it was juju. Did they have a pot that never went empty? Mama interrupted my thoughts to give me Baby. I collected her and fed her spoons of my rice, an apology of such, mama had stopped breastfeeding baby at 5 months. The milk just did not come out anymore. Since then, Baby ate bread soaked in tea or whatever we ate. Whenever I fed Baby, I would eat most of what was meant for her, dividing the bread and shoving it into my mouth before anyone saw me. I was hungry too. So I fed her rice, hoping it would be enough for God to forgive me. The party was coming to a close and mama had given us nylons of food to take home. Happily, I carried the nylon home. Later that night, as the five of us slept on the floor of the room, while mama and baby slept on the tiny foam, I dreamt of food. I came to appreciate life. After all, It was a celebration of life that filled my belly for the first time.Life is a gift. Mama had stopped saying it. Baby was now two. The rest of us were 4,5,8,10 and 12 respectively. Our eldest was supposed to start secondary school. The tiny primary school in our village was free, but the secondary school cost three thousand naira per term. Mama could not afford it. She borrowed a bag of corn from Iya Soji. She would roast it and use the profit to pay her. Whatever was left of the money would be for us. I followed mama to the roadside to sell the roasted corn. I liked watching the cars pass by. Where were they going? Where were they coming from? I always wondered. We roasted our corn on a quiet road, only cars passed by. The people in the cars were sometimes hungry and would stop to buy corn.Time went by, by 5pm, we made a total of #1,570.It was time to go home. Ola, our eldest came to meet us, it was his subtle reminder to mama to pay his fees. He carried the remaining corn and we started walking home together. Mama and I crossed the road without Ola, who had spotted a mango tree with low hanging fruit and stopped to pluck some. We kept walking, he’d catch up. I heard a car coming and turned around. Ola was standing in the middle of the road, frozen. "Move!" I screamed, but my lips would not open. The car hit Ola throwing him into the air; a strange sight, before he landed back on the floor. There was blood, Mama was screaming, I was frozen, the lone driver was shouting sorry. He flung an envelope out of his window and drove off. Mama was clutching Ola and screaming. I stared at the mangoes and corn scattered on the road. Mama dragged Ola to the side of the road and cradled his head to her bosom. I ran back to the village to call someone. By the time I returned, mama was sitting beside Ola\'s body with the envelope. He was already dead. The men carried him back to the village. Mama held my hand and we walked back to the village together, not talking, not crying. When we got back, no one was home but we met people in front of our room crying for us, Mama pushed her way through, banging the door when we got in and locking us in. News had traveled. Where were my siblings? Mama took out the envelope and counted the money- #30,000. She started crying and screaming, but even in her rage she did not tear the money, she did not throw it away. Ola always said he\'ll bring us wealth like his name implied. In a way, he did. His death had given us money we never had. He was buried that night. Iya Soji brought my siblings home later, along side some food. She hugged mama and promised to come back the following day. There was a little more food to eat, a little more space to sleep. I had always wanted these things. Life gifted it to me but took my brother\'s life. I was happy we had food, I was happy about the money mama hid under the foam when she heard iya Soji\'s knock. I was happy I would stretch my leg a little bit more since Ola’s space was now empty. I was also sad. Life is a gift, was death a gift too?\n\n-Odunuga . J . Moyosoluwa.')
