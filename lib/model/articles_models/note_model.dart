          'Class Achievers \'2016-2021\n\nWalking down the memory lane of year 2016, when we all got juggled into law. To some of us, it was a dream come true while to others it was random.\n\nWe all have several reasons we are in OOULAWSS. We are a family with different backgrounds, culture , and religion. We own up to several perspectives regarding salient issues. We are divided and United.\n\nWe have only one goal in common, to bag the “Legum Baccalaureus (LL.B)” other goals flow from this.\n\nIn year 2016 during our freshers competition, I saw about a few of us being energetic while answering the question “why are you studying law?”. Many of us screamed “to fight for human rights”.\n\nIt is not a hidden truth that in Year 1 we weren’t exposed to the realities and branches of the legal profession.\n\nFor many of us that wanted to practice, our goals were streamlined to just one thing “ litigation and activism” while some others thought about “business or some other profession”.\n\nI celebrate the years we didn’t have it all figured out. I celebrate our growing years. I celebrate years of self-reflection and I celebrate years of understanding. I raise my glass  cheering to years of more revelation, exposure and self reflection. Sure, Bagging “LL.B Hons” is a great deal. I mean, we were all restricted to stay in one town/state for 5years. Now, we are set to move forward, with the same fierceness and unrelenting spirit.\n\nDear Achiever, I welcome you to the end of the beginning.\n\nThe end I pictured since 2016, beaming at the feeling of becoming a graduate of law.\n\nWe are still lawyers in the making, not baking but almost made.\n\nDo you have a story to tell?\n\nYou sure do.\n\nWhat is life after school?\n\nRemember it was my song when I campaigned for the office of the President, Law Students’ Society.\n\n“Life After School Starts Here in School and as we Build Capacity We Propel”.\n\nWhat do you want to do after school?\n\nAfter LL.B Hons what next?\n\nDon’t fret, be calm as you make decisions.\n\nThe first thing you do to win is to always believe in yourself. To do this, remember your tenacity when you were an undergraduate.\n\nBelieve in yourself!\n\nYou can do all things through Christ who strengthens you.\n\nBuilding capacity is not about the grades,\n\nIt is what you do with the grades that matters.\n\nRemember, you have something to offer “LL.B Hons”. You do not fall within the category of “Nemo Dat Quod Non Habeat”\n\nYou have something to offer irrespective of your grades, use it to BUILD CAPACITY and PROPEL!\n\nWelcome to a new dispensation,\n\nWelcome to a new realization,\n\nWelcome to tomorrow,\n\nLook in the mirror, you’re a Graduate of Law.\n\nNow take a bow!

          'Farewell speech\n\nFaculty of Law, Olabisi Onabanjo University opened like a door. Peeping through the room, I saw numerous bounties. So, I was assured that LL.B is just one of them.\n\nMy LL.B journey has indeed been enlightening, interesting and I can gladly say I have no regrets studying law as opposed to my dispassionate attitude towards law in the first place. For this reason, I cease this opportunity to say a Titanic thanks to my parents, Sunday Posu and Abosede Posu for the great push and the unflinching support, financially, psychologically and spiritually towards completing the first phase of my legal career.\n\nCourses like Nigeria Legal System, Law of Succession, Law of Contract, Law of Equity among several others have not only improved my legal intelligence but also my moral intelligence. I’ve learnt honesty, integrity and transparency as core values. The legal profession is indeed a catalyst for the desired change we all envisage and I am resolute about being an agent of that change, So help me God.\n\nIn my bag, I have virtues like resiliency, spiritual growth, career growth, respect, emotional.\n\nintelligence, broadened horizon, great network, among several others. Notably among these bounties are the learnings and impacts made. I’m forever grateful to CLASFON, the beautiful family that enriched me and built my capacity as an academic secretary and a spiritual leader.\n\nTo the prestigious Legal Magnates and Company, I am super grateful for the capacity built in terms of the premium learnings and exposure garnered towards promoting legal intelligence. It has been a fulfilling experience transmitting the same and even more to my fellow magnates. Just like 9 months, when a baby is conceived and the joy of a mother knows no bound, so also is my joy boundless by the great feats magnates are making. You all are my Pride.\n\nIt’s indeed been a great experience working with intellectuals and people of like minds. The zest for excellence and being the best is fascinating and infectious. Please keep the flag flying. We all are going to meet at the apogee.\n\nMy special gratitude goes to my mentors - Magnate International Muyiwa Odubela, Esq., Magnate International Damilola Awotula, Esq. and Adebola Soyode, Esq. who are enviable products of this great citadel of learning for being a great source of motivation to me both in their words and deeds.\n\nI won’t fail to acknowledge the labour of love of my lecturers and the Dean who have nourished me with their premium knowledge, priceless wisdom, prayers and goodwill. Thank you so much for all. Your girl would continually make you proud by God’s grace. I would also like to thank the whole make up of OOU faculty of law, the non-teaching staff inclusive for their love and unflinching assistance. God bless you all.\n\nTo my fellow Legal achievers, great minds and beautiful people – one of the bounties, I received. Thank you for making this journey an interesting one. Special thanks go to my reading mates – Khafilat, Salawa and Pastor Glory. At strategic points, I’ve worked and learnt together beyond the four walls of the classroom with some of these amazing minds and it has been a great working and learning experience. I look forward to greater collaborations together in the future with you all.\n\nTo my fellow learning colleagues in the lower levels, I would like to leave you with these final words; Embrace learning, correction and opportunities. They will take you far. Shun mediocrity, negative vibes and bad influence. They can mar you.\n\nMy profound gratitude goes to Almighty God for opening this door of great bounties unto me. The blessings and learnings in the bag are long lasting and indeed set to prepare me for the future.\n\n\nBY - FAVOUR POSU, LORD ADVOCATE, LEGAL MAGNATES AND COMPANY, OOU.'),

          'First and Foremost, I pay absolute obeisance to the Almighty God for the privilege to serve in this capacity. Secondly, I really appreciate every member of the FYB planning committee for their unflinching passion to bring the Fun week to a reality.  Honestly, it was topsy-turvy affair to work with such distinct personalities, the sentiments, rancor, disagreement and mostly importantly the unison. I can say this affirmatively that it was a platform to construe the nitty-gritty of sacrificial leadership. My heart felt gratitude goes to Mr Stephen Samson, for this crude words of encouragement and succor although the event and also my support, Noah Omotolani, the finance team for astutely working to set the balance, the media team, the dinner subcommittee, the outing subcommittee , the welfare subcommittee, the VS committee and every other committee who have all contributed assiduously to this reality “The FYB WEEK”. I must say for a fact, it has been a privilege to serve such  diversity of persons. It’s absolutely humbling and I pray that God will meet you all at the point of your needs and that we find purpose in due time, Cheers All for one, One for All.\n\nDavid Ademola Olajide,\nFYB chairman.

          'Nigeria Association of Muslim Law Students, Olabisi Onabanjo University Chapter. NAMLAS OOU.\n\nThe President’s Speech (Presented at the 2021 NAMLAS Annual Lecture)\n\nDear distinguished guests, kindly permit me to stand on the existing protocol. All praises and  adoration are due to Almighty Allah, the Lord of the Universe, the most gracious the most  merciful,master of the day of Judgment, He alone we worship and He alone we seek for help, we  pray that he guides us to the right path, the path of those he has shown his favors, not the path of  those who earned His anger nor the Path those who has gone astray. Amin.\n\nWith a heart full of joy, it is my wish to once again welcome you all present today to the 2021  NAMLAS Annual Lecture in honour of our father and the celebrated legal giant, Dr (Chief) Fassy  Adetokunboh Yusuf. Thank you for blessing this special occasion with your presence.\n\nThe Nigeria Association of Muslim Law students, Olabisi Onabanjo University (NAMLASOOU) is a  students body that strives to strike a balance between the Academic and religious life of her  members. In achieving this, we participate in numerous intellectual activities, which this annual  lecture forms a part of.\n\nThe NAMLAS Annual Lecture has over the years created a forum for discussion of trending and  pertinent issues of National Importance from both the Legal and Islamic perspectives. This is to  ensure the efficient investment in the intellect of members. The theme for this year’s lecture is  EVOLUTION OF DIGITAL CURRENCY: POLICIES AND EFFECTS ON MODERN ECONOMIES.\n\nIn furtherance of our objective as an association, we launched in this 20/21 NAMLAS  Administration, our National annual essay in honour of Late Chief Idowu Sofola SAN. The basic aim  of this competition is to ensure that members develop sound research and writing skills and sharpen their critical thinking skills which builds them and makes them exceptional as students  and at the same time trains them to be seasoned legal practitioners in the near future.\n\nBeing a very structured and organized association, NAMLAS organizes and participates in a number  of yearly activities which essentially grooms the members and all law students at large, builds their  capacity, expose them to the best students practices world over and ultimately, prepares them for the legal profession. On this list is our annual Court and Chambers visitation, which essentially is  aimed at exposing members and law students generally to the procedural aspects of law. During this  administration our Court and Chambers visitation was made to the Lagos State High Court, Babalakin  & Co Legal Practitioners and also to Olaseinde Karim and Co Legal Practitioners.\n\nWe also participate in our annual Inter and Intra school moot and mock competition, and as well  organize weekly tutorials for members and all law students. We also give back to the society by  providing humanitarian services to the needy on a yearly basis one of which is our partnership with  the Prisoner’s Right Advocacy Initiative where we volunteer as tutors to the inmates at the Nigeria  Correctional Service facilities in Ogun state.\n\nThe previous administration featured the launch of the NAMLAS OOU Internship Scheme. A defined  internship program which ensures the seamless procurement of internship placements at law firms  during long holidays.\n\nI am confident to state categorically that all these activities distinguish us and make us stand out among our peers in school, and also at the Nigerian Law school and Legal Profession at large.\n\nI will not forget to add that the welfarism of our members also is at the top of our objectives as an  association. In furtherance of this objective, we have in place the NAMLAS OOU Trust Fund for the sole purpose of assisting indigent members in paying their school fees. We’ll greatly appreciate your  generous donations to this cause.\n\nFurthermore, it is the tradition of our association to yearly donate to our faculty, a utility project which serves as our contribution to our faculty’s development. Our plan this administration is to  donate a modern carport to the faculty. We however could not proceed with the construction due  to the reason that the construction of a new faculty building is ongoing and we were advised by the  Dean to wait till the faculty construction is completed in order to get a suitable place to erect our proposed project. We have thus decided to create a trust for the purpose of this project execution  which shall be under the supervision of the faculty.\n\nTruly, NAMLAS is more than just an association, but a big family. This family positively changed my  life as a student of this great citadel of learning. This I will be forever grateful for. I want to especially  appreciate our staff advisers in the person of Mrs A.K.A Kolawole, Mrs O.A Ayanleye and Alhaji Taiwo  Egberongbe. They’ve been the giants who have shouldered this great association and ensured the  smooth run of all our activities. We’ve received so much love, care and guidance from them and it is  my hope and prayer that we continue to make them proud.\n\nIt is my desire to also appreciate the current executives of this association. I must state that their  diligence, hard work and commitment ensured the overall success of this administration. They are  the best people I’ve worked with all my life. Jazakum Llahu Khairan to you all.\n\nAlso, I wish to sincerely appreciate every member of this great NAMLAS family. Thank you all for your all time cooperation, support, love and sacrifices. May almighty continue to bestow His  blessings upon you all. Jazakum Llahu Khairan, Alhamdulilahi Robbil A’lamin for an amazing  administration. This is to encourage the next administration to maintain the standard of this  association and even raise it higher, put their trust in Allah and give their best to ensure the  continual growth of the association. It is my prayer that Allah make it easy.\n\nAnd now my watch has ended! NAMLAS is family forever though.\n\nMaasalam.\nBadrudeen Adeola Lawal\nPresident, NAMLAS OOU 2020/2021\n\n11-11-21 ')
